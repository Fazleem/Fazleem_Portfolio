# [Project 1: Digit Recognization: Project Overview](https://github.com/Fazleem/Digit_Recognizer)

## About
This is the Hello World program for the Computer Vision. MNIST ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology") is the de facto “hello world” dataset of computer vision. Since its release in 1999, this classic dataset of handwritten images has served as the basis for benchmarking classification algorithms. As new machine learning techniques emerge, MNIST remains a reliable resource for researchers and learners alike.

### Goal

The goal of the project is to correctly identify digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images
